# 👋 Hi, I’m @Damiem
🏫 I teach coding to people of all ages. Prior to that I have 10+ years of developer and leadership experience in banking, medical device, nutrition, and energy. 

👀 I’m interested in Data & Analytics, Full Stack Development, and DevOps. 

💻😵‍💫 I spend a little too much time in ZSH.

🌱 I’m currently learning cloud, currently seeking AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. 

🧑‍💼 I’m looking to collaborate on ZSH scripts, Obsidian Notes and Python lessons.
